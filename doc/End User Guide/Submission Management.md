## Flagging

On the "submissions" page, the "flags" column denotes the total number of flags for each entry. There are ways for submissions to be flagged in the platform:
1. Auto-flagged submissions are those which the computer flagged as inappropriate. If a submission has been automically flagged, an admin can remove the flag but not reinstate it. To do that, use the regular "Flagged" field.
2. To flag a submission on the "Submissions" page, click the button in the "Flagged" column corresponding to that entry. Flagging a submission is a global change -  if you flag a submission here, it will be flagged for all other users. 
3. To flag a submission while reviewing it, check the "flag as inappropriate" on the right side of the review screen.
  

## Previewing Submissions

To preview a submission, visit the "submissions" page and find the entry you would like to preview. Under the "options" column, click the blue button labeled "view submissions," which triggers a pop-up showing the submission's content.

## Managing reviews

To manage a review, visit the "submissions" page and find the entry you would like to manage. Under the "options" column, click the blue button labeled "manage review." The pop-up contains information on possible actions. You may:
1. Add a review
2. Assign the submission to another reviewer by selecting their email in the dropdown
3. Remove the submission from the system
4. View details of the submission

## Pinning

To pin a submission, click the button in the "Pinned" column cooresponding to that entry. Pinning a submission brings it to the top of the list, displaying it before all other reviews (which are listed in chronological order). Pinning is a global change - if you you pin a submission here, it will be pinned for all other users.
