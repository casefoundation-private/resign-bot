# My Review Queue

Once logged into the Review-O-Matic system, click the "My Review Queue" tab to show submissions that are assigned to you for review. From this queue, you will be able to access your pending submissions to review, and completed submissions in the system.

## Performing a review

To perform a review, click the "My Review Queue" tab to bring up a list of all entries assigned to the user. Under the "Options" column, click the blue button marked "Review Submission." This action loads the corresponding review page for that entry.

<i>Note: To recuse yourself from a submission for any reason, click the red "Recuse Myself" button under the "Options" column on the review queue. This will remove the submission from your queue and reassign it to another reviewer.</i>

On each review page, the left side displays the "Submitted Information." The section on the right - "My Review" - contains the questions for the reviewer answer about the submission. This is where the reviewer can check the "Flag as Inappropriate" box.

To save a review (without submitting it), click the blue "Save" button at the bottom of "My Review" section.
