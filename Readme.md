## About

The Review-O-Matic is a tool developed by the Case Foundation to handle the job of collecting and vetting user-submitted content. The system collects submissions via direct input or via an import from another service such as Wufoo. Once in the Review-O-Matic, the newly submitted content goes to a user for review. That reviewer grades and categorizes the content based on customizable prompts. Administrators can then explore the reviewed (and unreviewed) stories as part of a final vetting process.

### Other Features

* Public feed of approved stories
* Administrators and reviewers can manually flag inappropriate stories
* The system will also automatically flag submitted content if it contains bad language
* Ability to set "embargo" schedules where new content is held from the public for a period such as over nights and weekends
* CSV export of all submitted stories
* Ability to reassign reviews
* Designed for customization
